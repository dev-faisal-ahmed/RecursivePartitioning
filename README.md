The application features an interactive and engaging user interface, where users are
presented with a screen hosting two buttons. These buttons empower users to dynamically
split the container either vertically or horizontally, with the flexibility to continue the process
infinitely. The user experience is further enriched by the option to minimize containers at any
point with the touch of a button. Additionally, the application generates a unique color for
each container, adding a visually appealing and dynamic aspect to the user interface.
